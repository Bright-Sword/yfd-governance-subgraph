## DFI Governance Subgraph

This subgraph indexes and exposes in GraphQL all the event data related to the [VOTX Token](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3bebdce1219c394dfaa1df781f9aa31d179dff47) and [Governance](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2018f98B50C707AECfbd2F22622869Bc02A3f869) contracts from Zoracles, providing an easy access to Token holder and Delegates information, Proposals and votes casted, and all the relationships between those entities.

A live version of this subgraph can be found [here 👆🏻](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/warlord-dev/governance), along with useful queries and examples already available on the playground.
